* Whichever function is called, at the end of it
	- Load KBD
	- (for blackout)
	- IF M != go back to top and continue (also make sure SMM += 1)
	- ELSE:, go back to RESET (also make sure that this function is
	  properly integrated and this func isnt the reason for the fuck ups.
	  In other words, make sure starting from the top at this func is OK
          and its not the case that we have to do 2 mini-functions within the
          blackout and whiteout funcs

	- (for whiteout)
	- If M = 0 go back to top and continue (also make sure SMM += 1)
	- ELSE: go back to reset (same message as above)
