# Unit 4.9: Project 4


* Next week we're going to take all the chips and logic gates we've already made and assemble them together to create the HACK computer


* Project 4 Tasks:
	- Write a simple algebraic program
	- Write a simple interactive program


* Project 4.1

	- Mult: A program performing R2 = R0 * R1

* Project 4.2

	- Fill: A simple interactive program

	- If a key (any key) is pressed, the entire screen is filled
	
	- If no key is being pressed, the screen is white/clear/empty

	- Has to be updated every time step

	- Have to be able to see if any key is pressed (2 or8s and an or between those two or8s)
	- Have to be able to draw the entire screen black


	- Addressing the memory requires working with pointers


	- Testing:
		- Select 'no animation'
		- Manual testing




* Best Practice

	- Well-written low-level code is:
		- Short
		- Efficient
		- Elegant
		- Self-describing


* Tips
	- Use symbolic variables and labels
	- Use sensible variable and label names
	- Variables: lower-case
	- Labels: Upper-Case
	- Use indentation
	- Start with pseudo code



# Unit 4.10: Perspectives

	* Typical assembly langs (machine langs) are much more rich than the HACK assembly lang
		- Offer more commands, data types, operations, etc. 

		- This can all still be delivered to the HACK computer at a higher software level



	* A compiler is a program that takes one program written in a high level language (java, c, python) and translates it into
	  assembly
