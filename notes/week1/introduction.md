# Unit 0.1: The Road Ahead 

* A program is just a bunch of letters and symbols 
    - How do these letters and symbols actually do anything?

        - All letters and symbols are represented by numbers (ASCII)
            * ex: In ASCII, p is represented by the number 112


* The main secret of Computer Science is that you do not have to worry about the 'How?'
    - Abstraction is key!

    - Do not worry about the how, worry about the 'what'

        - What is this program/function/variable supposed to do. Not 'how'


* Use abstraction to break complex problems into more manageable sub-problems




# Unit 0.2: From Nand to Hack

* In this course we are going to be buildin a computer called HACK
    - It will have ROM, CPU, and RAM
    - It will be connected to a standard keyboard and display unit and will be able
      to run normal programs (pong, tetris, calculator, etc.)


* General picture 
    - Write a program
    - Compiler 
    - VM Translator 
    - Assembler 
    - Digital Design 
    - Gate Logic 
    - Electrical Engineering
    - Physics (solid state)
    


* Nand is one of the most elementary logic gates (function will be discussed later)
    - From nand, or, and, not, nor, & xor gates, we can build elementary logic gates
    - From these gates, we can use combinational and sequential logic to build
      things such as registers, RAMs, and CPUs

    - Then from this chip set we can build a full computer (HACK)

    - So that this computer can run codes, we will also implement an assembler



* How are we going to build the chip?
    - Hardware engineers build chips on specialized software (hardware simulators)
        - Use computers to build computers (recursive)


* Roadmap 
    - Week 1: Elementary Logic Gates
    - Week 2: Arithmetic-Logic-Unit (ALU)
    - Week 3: Registers and Memory
    - Week 4: Computer Architecture 
    - Week 5: Creating an Assembler



# Unit 0.3: From Hack to Tetris 

* The second part of this course will be more software focused 

* We will build an assembler, standard library, and mini OS to run on the computer
